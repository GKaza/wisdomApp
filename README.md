# A fun game application

The player fills a form where he must choose his name and game difficulty and cannot proceed otherwise. Then based on the difficulty he picked, 10 random questions are fetched from an API and the game begins. Player picks 1 out of 4 possible answers until all questions are answered. He is then presented with his results where he can also continue to see where he stands in the highscore list.


## Important Notes

- project was made using VueJS
- Api used is [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
- localStorage is used to save the 3 highscore lists based on the difficulty picked
- fonts and CSS styling used to mimic old-school arcade games
